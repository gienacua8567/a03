</strong></p><p><strong>But we believe working out should be fun, easy and inexpensive. And that's where these innovative fitness hacks come in.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>These hacks will help you cut the excuses, so you can finally make fitness a regular part of your daily routine. Remember the key is variety to an increasingly boring routine. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- If you're into music while working out, as most of us are,  you’d probably have a playlist already set whenever you’re working out. You may not realize but your favorite tunes might be contributing to that feeling of being stale in your workout routine. Try mixing up your playlist. Better yet, try listening to some audio book or podcasts while working out especially those you’ve been aching to listen to but just couldn’t find the time. Well, you can kill two birds with one stone. Challenge yourself to listen to your audio book or podcast only while working out. That should give your whole routine a twist especially if you want to get to the end of the story as fast as you can.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- If you’re worrying about dumbbells and other gym equipment, fret not. You can always use alternate weights for weight focused workouts right at home. You can use water containers or soup cans for weights. Even bagfuls of rice or books placed in a bag can be used if you need heavier weights.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- One of the many popular workout exercises nowadays is the plank. Make a twist and make the plank exercise more effective by placing towels under your arms and/or feet. Use this setup to be able to move or slide arms and feet independently forward, backwards, and sideways. You’ll find that you've innovated the simple plank to stretch other specific muscle groups as well. You’ll also get a better burn this way.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Remember that every small effort to stay physically active accumulates over time and thus contributes to your overall health. To keep track of the small efforts you have done, you might want to invest in a fitness tracker device or app. This way you’ll be able to set goals for your effort and perform them progressively. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Make every opportunity count. During days off or free time, while watching your favorite show or movie at home, Do some routines during a program break or if you're watching a movie, perhaps you can identify trigger words that will make you do a routine wherever it is mentioned.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- If needed, try to get help or guidance for a workout routine. Don’t worry if you don’t have enough money to afford a personal trainer. You don’t necessarily need one. A lot of fitness apps abound nowadays and the good thing about it is that even some really good ones are actually free. You just need to commit your time to it.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Did you know that taking the stairs is a great and effective way to workout. It is also easily accessible so there’ll be lots of opportunity for you to take it. So, take it! You might probably have it at home or even in the office. What’s good about working the stairs is that it is a low-impact workout that is just as effective as running or jumping.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Commit your time to fitness. It doesn’t take that long. All you need is to make sure to do it with such consistency. Use a calendar to schedule a workout just as you would a meeting. This way, you can ensure that it is part of your plans for the day. Once you get used to it, it’ll be easier to stick to it and make it a habit in no time.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Try to multitask your workout routine. Combine exercises that target different muscle groups all at the same time. Since time is minimal, make every minute of your time at the gym count and use it  wisely. For example, you can combine cardio and strength training at one go. Perhaps doing bicep curls or shoulder presses while on a cardio machine.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Attend some group sessions. Make your fitness routine a social event that allows opportunities to network with more people or simply to gain friends. It’s more fun to workout when doing it with friends. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- If you can’t help missing out on your daily fitness routine, make sure to commit at least 10 minutes for it. Whether you jog, run, walk, go up and down on a flight of stairs or what have you is up to you. The important thing is you are able to exert a burst of effort doing any physical activity. Research has consistently shown that short bursts of activity are better than nothing.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- If you are an early bird type of a person and working out is your daily first, prepare all your gear the night before or even sleep on your gym clothes. That way, you would have eliminated any excuse before you second guess yourself about going the following morning.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Identify milestones in trying to keep with your workout schedule. Give yourself some incentive whenever you reach such a milestone. Put a dollar into it or treat yourself to something nice upon reaching goals.
